## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. To detect this Melanoma cancer at the early stage, we need to generate one CNN model which can accurately detect the correct CNN model.

## Conclusions
- From our first model, we came to a conclusion that the training and validation accuracy are not matching at all.
- After doing the augmentation, we make the model best fit and also made the validation accuracy nearer to training accuracy and also the validation loss is also stepping low in the final model.
